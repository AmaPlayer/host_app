            <article class="article-content">
                <p>
                    On April 11, 2011, Arunima Sinha was a 24-year-old national-level volleyball player traveling by
                    train
                    to Delhi for a sports trial. Within hours, her life would change forever in the most brutal way
                    imaginable.
                    But what happened next would inspire millions around the world.
                </p>

                <h2>The Fall</h2>
                <p>
                    Late at night, a group of robbers boarded the Padmavat Express. When Arunima resisted their attempt
                    to
                    snatch her bag and gold chain, they pushed her out of the moving train. She fell onto the tracks,
                    and
                    before she could move, another train ran over her left leg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She lay on the tracks for hours, bleeding and in excruciating pain, before someone found her and
                    called
                    for help. At the hospital, doctors had no choice but to amputate her left leg below the knee. Her
                    right
                    leg was also severely damaged, with multiple fractures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a national-level athlete, losing a leg meant losing everything—her career, her dreams, her
                    identity.
                    Many would have given up. But Arunima was different.
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "When I opened my eyes in the hospital and saw my leg was gone, I made a decision. I would not let
                    this
                    define me. I would climb Mount Everest."
                </div>

                <h2>The Fight</h2>
                <p>
                    From her hospital bed, Arunima declared her goal: she would become the first female amputee in the
                    world
                    to climb Mount Everest. People thought she was delusional. She had never climbed a mountain before.
                    She had just lost her leg. How could she possibly climb the world's highest peak?
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Arunima was determined. After months of recovery, she began training at the Nehru Institute of
                    Mountaineering in Uttarkashi. The training was brutal. Climbing with a prosthetic leg meant dealing
                    with
                    constant pain, blisters, and the risk of frostbite. Every step was a battle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The prosthetic leg would dig into my stump," she recalls. "The pain was unbearable. But I kept
                    thinking:
                    if I give up now, those robbers win. And I refused to let them win."
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-mountain" style="margin-right: 0.5rem;"></i> The Training Journey</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        Arunima trained for over a year, climbing smaller peaks to prepare for Everest. She climbed
                        Island Peak
                        (6,189m) in Nepal and other challenging mountains, learning to navigate ice, snow, and thin air
                        with
                        her prosthetic leg.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Comeback</h2>
                <p>
                    On May 21, 2013, Arunima Sinha stood on the summit of Mount Everest at 8,849 meters (29,032 feet).
                    She became the first female amputee in the world to conquer the world's highest peak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The climb was grueling. At one point, her prosthetic leg malfunctioned in the extreme cold. She had
                    to
                    continue with a damaged prosthetic, relying on sheer willpower and the support of her team. But she
                    didn't stop. She couldn't stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "When I reached the summit, I cried," Arunima says. "Not because of the pain, but because I had
                    proven
                    that nothing is impossible. Your body may break, but your spirit doesn't."
                </p>

                <h2>A New Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Arunima didn't stop at Everest. She went on to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents,
                    becoming
                    the first female amputee to complete the "Seven Summits" challenge. She has also climbed numerous
                    other
                    peaks, always pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, Arunima runs the Arunima Foundation, which provides free prosthetic limbs and sports training
                    to
                    people with disabilities. She travels the world, sharing her story and inspiring others to overcome
                    their
                    own challenges.
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "Your body may break, but your spirit doesn't. Disability is not inability. It's just a different
                    ability."
                </div>

                <p>
                    Arunima Sinha's story is not just about climbing mountains. It's about refusing to be a victim. It's
                    about
                    turning tragedy into triumph. It's about proving that the human spirit can overcome anything.
