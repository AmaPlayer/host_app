                    The silence in the arena was deafening. Just moments before, the crowd had been roaring, but now,
                    all eyes were on Kartik, clutching his knee on the hardwood floor. For many, it looked like the end.
                    For Kartik, it was just the beginning of the hardest chapter of his life.
                </p>

                <h2>The Fall</h2>
                <p>
                    "I remember the sound more than the pain," Kartik recalls. "A pop that echoed in my head." The
                    diagnosis was a complete tear of the ACL. Doctors said he might walk normally again, but playing
                    professional basketball? That was a long shot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He lost his scholarship. The scouts stopped calling. The future he had built in his mind crumbled
                    overnight.
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "They told me to find a new dream. But you don't just turn off a fire that burns inside you."
                </div>

                <h2>The Grind in the Shadows</h2>
                <p>
                    Rehab was brutal. Six hours a day, six days a week. While his former teammates were posting
                    highlight reels, Kartik was learning how to balance on one leg again. He spent months in an empty
                    gym, shooting free throws from a chair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "That's where I found my real game," he says. "When you strip away the athleticism, what are you
                    left with? I had to rebuild my shot, my mind, my patience. I watched hours of film. I visualized
                    every play."
                </p>

                <h2>The Return</h2>
                <p>
                    Eighteen months later, Kartik stepped back onto the court for a local tryout. He wasn't the same
                    explosive player who could dunk from the free-throw line. he was smarter, sharper, and hungrier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his first game back, he dropped 32 points. Not with flashy dunks, but with surgical precision.
                    The scouts who had written him off were suddenly back in the stands, taking notes.
                </p>

                <h2>A New Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, Kartik is leading the league in scoring. But his legacy isn't just about points. It's about
                    resilience. He runs a weekend camp for injured athletes, teaching them that a setback is just a
                    setup for a comeback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The injury didn't take away my game," Kartik smiles. "It gave me a new one."
                </p>
