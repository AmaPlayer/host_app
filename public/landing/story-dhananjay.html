                    The "pitch" wasn't grass. It was a narrow alleyway between two apartment buildings, paved with
                    cracked concrete and lined with parked scooters. But for Dhananjay, it was the San Siro. This is
                    where he learned to dribble around obstacles that didn't move and defenders who played rough.
                </p>

                <h2>No Boots, No Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    "We didn't have gear," Dhananjay laughs. "My first pair of boots was a hand-me-down that was two
                    sizes too big. I stuffed the toes with newspaper."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Playing in the streets taught him something academies couldn't: survival. You had to be quick, you
                    had to be tough, and you had to keep the ball close. Those close-control skills became his trademark
                    signature.
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "The street doesn't lie. If you can't play, you don't get picked. It's the purest form of the game."
                </div>

                <h2>The Discovery</h2>
                <p>
                    A local scout was passing by the neighborhood to visit a relative. He saw a kid weaving through
                    traffic—literally—with a ball glued to his feet. He stopped his car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "He asked me where I played," Dhananjay remembers. "I pointed at the ground and said, 'Here.' He
                    told me to come to trials the next day."
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the trials, Dhananjay looked out of place in his worn-out jersey among kids in full kits. But
                    once the whistle blew, the kit didn't matter. He scored a hat-trick in twenty minutes.
                </p>

                <h2>Rising Star</h2>
                <p>
                    Dhananjay's rise has been meteoric. From the local youth league to the national U-19 squad, he has
                    carried the spirit of the streets with him. He plays with a flair and unpredictability that
                    defenders hate and fans love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He hasn't forgotten where he came from. Last month, he donated 500 pairs of boots to the kids in his
                    old neighborhood. "Someone needs to fill those shoes," he says.
                </p>
