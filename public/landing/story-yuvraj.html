                <p>
                    In 2011, Yuvraj Singh stood at the pinnacle of cricket glory. He had just been named Player of the
                    Tournament
                    in the ICC Cricket World Cup, helping India lift the trophy after 28 years. The world was at his
                    feet.
                    But within months, his life would take a devastating turn that would test every ounce of his
                    strength.
                </p>

                <h2>The Fall</h2>
                <p>
                    During the World Cup, Yuvraj had been coughing blood. He ignored it, pushing through the pain to
                    deliver
                    match-winning performances. But after the tournament, the symptoms worsened. In February 2012, he
                    was
                    diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called mediastinal seminoma—a germ cell tumor between his
                    lungs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The diagnosis was a shock. At 30, in the prime of his career, Yuvraj faced the possibility that he
                    might
                    never play cricket again. Worse, he faced the possibility that he might not survive.
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "When the doctor told me I had cancer, my first thought wasn't about cricket. It was about life
                    itself."
                </div>

                <h2>The Fight</h2>
                <p>
                    Yuvraj flew to the United States for treatment. Chemotherapy ravaged his body. He lost weight, his
                    hair fell out,
                    and his legendary stamina disappeared. The man who could hit six sixes in an over struggled to walk
                    up a flight of stairs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Chemotherapy drains you," Yuvraj later recalled. "Not just physically, but mentally. You lose
                    confidence.
                    You wonder if you'll ever be the same person again."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many in the cricket world believed his career was over. Even if he survived, they said, he would
                    never regain
                    the explosive power and fitness required for international cricket.
                </p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-heartbeat" style="margin-right: 0.5rem;"></i> The Treatment Journey</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        Yuvraj underwent three cycles of chemotherapy over several months. The treatment was successful
                        in
                        eliminating the cancer, but the road to recovery was long and uncertain.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Comeback</h2>
                <p>
                    But Yuvraj Singh was not ready to give up. After being declared cancer-free, he began the grueling
                    process
                    of rebuilding his body and his game. He trained relentlessly, pushing through the fatigue and doubt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In September 2012, just seven months after completing chemotherapy, Yuvraj returned to international
                    cricket.
                    He played a Twenty20 match against New Zealand, and though he didn't set the world on fire, he was
                    back.
                    He was alive. He was playing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the next few years, Yuvraj continued to represent India. He played in the 2014 T20 World Cup,
                    the 2017 Champions Trophy, and numerous other matches. He proved that cancer could not defeat a
                    determined athlete.
                </p>

                <h2>A New Legacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, Yuvraj Singh is more than a cricket legend. He is a symbol of hope and resilience. He
                    established
                    the YouWeCan Foundation to raise awareness about cancer and support those fighting the disease.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Cancer taught me that life is precious," Yuvraj says. "Every day is a gift. Every match is a
                    blessing.
                    I want to use my story to inspire others who are fighting their own battles."
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "Illness cannot defeat a determined athlete. The mind is stronger than any disease."
                </div>

                <p>
                    Yuvraj's comeback wasn't just about cricket. It was about proving that the human spirit can overcome
                    anything. It was about showing that setbacks, no matter how devastating, are just setups for
                    comebacks.
