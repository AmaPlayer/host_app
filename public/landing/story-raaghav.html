                <p>
                    In track and field, you don't race against people. You race against a clock that doesn't care who
                    you are, how hard you trained, or how much you want it. It only knows numbers. For Raghav, the
                    number was 10.50.
                </p>

                <h2>The Plateau</h2>
                <p>
                    For two years, Raghav was stuck. He ran 10.55s. Then 10.54s. Then 10.56s. He was good, but he
                    wasn't great. He wasn't qualifying for the nationals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's mental torture," Raghav explains. "You train for hundreds of hours for an improvement you
                    can't even see with the naked eye. I was ready to quit. I thought I had hit my genetic limit."
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "I wasn't losing to others. I was losing to myself."
                </div>

                <h2>The Breakthrough</h2>
                <p>
                    His coach changed one thing: his start. They spent three months doing nothing but the first 10
                    meters. Explode. Reset. Explode. Reset. Thousands of times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It was boring. It was repetitive. And it hurt," Raghav says. "But then, at the state qualifiers, I
                    felt it. The gun went off, and for the first time, I felt like I was being shot out of a cannon, not
                    just running."
                </p>

                <h2>Crossing the Line</h2>
                <p>
                    He crossed the finish line and looked at the clock. 10.42s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The stadium erupted. Those 0.13 seconds were the difference between going home and going to
                    Nationals. It was the difference between being a local runner and a national contender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Raghav is now training for the Asian Games. He knows the clock is still ticking, but now, he knows
                    he can beat it.
                </p>
