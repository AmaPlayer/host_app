                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This story focuses on Lance Armstrong's battle with cancer and survival.
                        While his later athletic achievements were controversial due to doping violations, his cancer
                        survival
                        story remains an inspiration to millions fighting the disease.</p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    In October 1996, Lance Armstrong was a 25-year-old professional cyclist at the peak of his career.
                    He had just signed a lucrative contract and was considered one of the most promising riders in the
                    sport.
                    Then came the diagnosis that would change everything: advanced testicular cancer.
                </p>

                <h2>The Fall</h2>
                <p>
                    The cancer was aggressive. It had already spread from his testicles to his lungs, abdomen, and
                    brain.
                    Doctors found multiple tumors in his lungs and two lesions in his brain. His blood markers were off
                    the charts.
                    Some doctors gave him less than a 40% chance of survival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "When the doctor told me I had cancer, I thought my life was over," Armstrong recalls. "Not just my
                    career—my life.
                    I was 25 years old, and I was being told I might not see 26."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The diagnosis was devastating. His cycling contract was immediately canceled. Sponsors disappeared.
                    The future he had worked so hard to build vanished overnight. But the biggest battle wasn't about
                    cycling anymore—it was about survival.
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "Cancer was the best thing that ever happened to me. I don't know why I got it. I just know I got
                    it,
                    and I'm alive."
                </div>

                <h2>The Fight</h2>
                <p>
                    Armstrong underwent aggressive treatment. First, surgery to remove the cancerous testicle. Then,
                    brain surgery
                    to remove the lesions. Finally, four cycles of intensive chemotherapy—a brutal cocktail of drugs
                    designed to
                    kill the cancer cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chemotherapy was excruciating. He lost his hair, his strength, and at times, his hope. He
                    vomited constantly.
                    His weight dropped. The athlete who could ride 200 kilometers in a day could barely walk to the
                    bathroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Chemo is like poison," he said. "You're trying to kill the cancer before it kills you. Every day
                    was a battle
                    just to get out of bed."
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-heartbeat" style="margin-right: 0.5rem;"></i> The Medical Battle</h3>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                        Armstrong chose an aggressive chemotherapy regimen that was harder on his body but less likely
                        to damage
                        his lungs—critical for a cyclist. The treatment lasted from October 1996 to February 1997. By
                        December 1996,
                        he was declared cancer-free.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Comeback</h2>
                <p>
                    Against all odds, Armstrong survived. In February 1997, just four months after starting treatment,
                    he was
                    declared cancer-free. But survival was only the first step. Could he return to professional cycling?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many doubted it. Cancer survivors rarely return to elite athletics. The physical toll is too great.
                    But Armstrong was determined. He began training again, slowly rebuilding his strength and endurance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1998, he returned to professional cycling. In 1999, just three years after his diagnosis, he won
                    the
                    Tour de France—the most prestigious race in cycling. He would go on to win it seven consecutive
                    times
                    (though these titles were later stripped due to doping violations).
                </p>

                <h2>The Legacy of Survival</h2>
                <p>
                    While Armstrong's athletic achievements became controversial, his impact on cancer awareness and
                    survivorship
                    remains significant. In 1997, he founded the Lance Armstrong Foundation (later renamed Livestrong),
                    which has
                    raised hundreds of millions of dollars for cancer research and support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Cancer taught me what's truly important," Armstrong said. "It's not about winning races. It's about
                    living.
                    It's about fighting for every day you have."
                </p>
                <p>
                    His story inspired millions of cancer patients around the world. The yellow Livestrong wristbands
                    became
                    a global symbol of hope and resilience. He showed that cancer doesn't have to be a death
                    sentence—that
                    survival is possible, even against the longest odds.
                </p>

                <div class="quote-block">
                    "Survival itself is a victory. Everything after that is a bonus."
                </div>

                <p>
                    Today, Lance Armstrong's story remains complex. His athletic legacy is tarnished by doping
                    violations.
                    But his survival story—his battle against cancer and his determination to live—continues to inspire
                    those
                    facing their own health battles.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The lesson isn't about perfection. It's about resilience. It's about fighting when the odds are
                    against you.
                    It's about proving that survival itself is the greatest victory of all.
                </p>
